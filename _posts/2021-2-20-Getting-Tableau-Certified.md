title: Passing Tableau Desktop Certified Associate exam for long-time Tableau users
categories: [Tableau]
excerpt: How I prepared for the Tableau Desktop CA exam
---

This post is meant for: 
- long-time Tableau users who have never taken the Tableau Desktop CA exam before but are relatively confident due to their experience with the product
- would like to use the least amount of time possible to prepare for the exam
 
 


## Here's what I did
All resources listed are free:
1. Read the official `exam prep guide` for the CA exam, do not skip the hands-on sample questions. Optional: also read the one for the Specialist exam.
2. Search for articles on `Tableau Help` page for the topics listed in the prep guide that you are not familiar with. Note that you can use online resources during the test so this is good practice.
3. Watch the `free training videos`. I watched maybe 60%-70% of the videos and did this with a browser extension to watch at 2x speed to save time.
4. Practice on `mock exams`. I used two sites for this (only the free stuff): [here](https://learningtableau.com/practice-quizzes/) & [here](http://www.learntableau.technology/p/tableau-desktop-certified-associate.html).
5. The `Visual Analysis Best Practices Guidebook` was also listed as one of the additional learning resources in the exam prep but personally I did not get any related questions during the exam. 
6. I also read around 3 other blog posts to get a rough idea of what to expect.

I think it is possible to complete everything above in one weekend.

## Exam Tips
- You get 2 hours to answer 36 questions. So you will probably finish with plenty of time left since not all of them are going to be hands-on questions. Personally I ran out of time during the mock exam (listed above). During the actual exam, I finished answering the questions before the first hour was up and then went back to check my answers with the extra time. 
- It may take some time for the proctor to go through the setup process (I think mine took about 20 minutes as they were taking some time to verify I was only using one monitor). The countdown timer will only start when the setup is done so no worries there.
- You will be warned not to use any keyboard shortcuts in the VM, this may be frustrating for long-time tableau users.
- Labelling datasources (eg Superstore_No_Join, Superstore_InnerJoin_Budget) and the sheets (eg Q1, Q2) clearly. You may find the need to connect to the same source file but with different joining criteria (or none at all) for different questions.
- I used Ethernet connection instead of WiFi and experienced no technical difficulties but I would suggest that you save the Tableau workbook from time to time if you intend to double check your answers at the end.


## Caution
- The pricetag is USD 250 after all so if you do not feel confident, the best thing to do would be to try to find more practice questions.
- On the slip side, try not to be over-confident! Use online resources to check your answers for the technical questions even if you are just slightly unsure.
